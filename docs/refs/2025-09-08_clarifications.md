Meeting broker & timing — Answered. Atilla will plan the corporate meetings; timing TBD.
Pilot count (Alisha vs others) — Deferred.
Channel cadence (weekly posts, start week & count) — Deferred.
Platform constraints (TikTok out; YouTube/Facebook only?) — Deferred.
Comp model (20% of net? or out-of-scope?) — Deferred / currently out-of-scope.
Team time constraints — Deferred.
Acceptance KPIs for cycle-1 — Deferred.
Deck location (repo under UNK-MKT-03?) — Not discussed. Pending preference.
