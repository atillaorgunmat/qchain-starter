## Apply RCI v2 â€” Governance-first question chain for cycle-1

### What
- Adds governance-first root (UNK-PGM-01) and Foundations layer (BIZ, ICP, GEO, IND, ROLE, OPS).
- Reclassifies execution root (UNK-MKT-01) as dependent on Foundations.
- Sets owners/agendas/priorities per node shells.
- Writes question files with depends_on links; updates QUESTION_GRAPH.yaml.
- Adds clarifications provenance doc.

### Why
- Aligns with reframed scope: surface/structure unknowns rather than fix outcome.

### How to review
- Confirm owners & agendas match decisions.
- Verify depends_on links mirror the graph.
- Confirm no destructive changes (add-only).

### Acceptance
- Chain & decision rights recorded (UNK-PGM-01).
- RACI/workflow drafts now have placeholders (UNK-ROLE-02, UNK-OPS-02).
- Foundations block Execution until answered.

### Provenance
- Grounded in attachments and 2025-09-08 clarifications.
